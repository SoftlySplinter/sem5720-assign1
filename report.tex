\section{Introduction}

In recent years, the number of \gls{TLD} in the \gls{DNS} has been increasing.
This is, in part, due to the introduction of \gls{ICANN}, the aim of which was
to promote competition in the registration of domain names.

Before the creation of \gls{ICANN} in 1998 there were a total of eight 
\gls{gTLD}; \glspl{TLD} which are not specific to a country or the 
infrastructure of \gls{DNS}. These eight were intended to have specific uses
(\texttt{com} for commercial entities, \texttt{gov} for government 
organisations, etc.) but since then a proportion of these have become truly
generic.

In 2000 and 2004 \gls{ICANN} successfully applied for and instated fifteen new
\glspl{gTLD} and have since gone on to create a program which reviews all 
applications for new \glspl{gTLD}\cite{icann2013gtlds}.


\section{Expansion of TLDs}
At time of writing there are a total of 364 \glspl{TLD}, of which 295 are 
\glspl{ccTLD}, 42 \glspl{gTLD} (three of which are restricted use), 15 
sponsored \glspl{TLD}, 11 used for testing and 1 (\texttt{.arpa}) dedicated to 
the infrastructure for \gls{DNS}\cite{root2013iana}.

There are two factors which have spurred the growth of \glspl{TLD}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Introduction of new \glspl{gTLD} by \gls{ICANN}
\item Support for non-Latin characters in the \gls{DNS}, allowing for 
      \glspl{ITLD}
\end{enumerate}


% Unicode in TLDs (Internationalised Domain Names).
Until October 2009\cite{icann2013idns} \glspl{TLD} could only consist of 
US-ASCII (or ``Latin'') characters. This changed with the approval of the
``IDN ccTLD Fast Track Process''\cite{icann2013final}, which allows countries 
to apply for \gls{IDN} \glspl{ccTLD} which represents their specific country 
(or territory) name in non-Latin script enabling users to access domain names
in their own language. %TODO this is almost too copypasta'd.

In more recent years, 2011 to be specific, \glspl{IDN} have also been approved 
for use in \glspl{gTLD}, allowing for a greater degree of freedom in 
international users.

% Increase in new TLDs (specifically gTLDs)
In hand with this there has been a fair increase in the number of \glspl{gTLD}
before 2010 there were only 22 \glspl{gTLD} available. On 12 January 2012,
applications for new \glspl{gTLD} opened and since then a total of 20 new 
\glspl{gTLD} have been added, including several \glspl{IDN}.

Even so, this is a drop in the ocean compared to the 1,930 applications 
\gls{ICANN} received and it is anticipated that the number of \glspl{gTLD} will
increase further in coming years.


\section{Non-technical Support of the Expansion of TLDs}
% Industry, product and service domains
% - self-descriptive domains.

% Non-Latin Script (IDN) and Foreign Language Domains
% - China, Russia, etc.

% More choice
% - Initially only around 22 generic TLDs
% - Overcrowding of .net, .com, .org, etc.

% Localisation
% - .london

% Segment Focusing
% - Professionals (.doctor, .med, etc.)

% Increase in innovation and competition.

% Brand Protection
