## Introduction

You are required to study the topic area given below and then produce a 2000 word report summarizing your findings.

Your report should include diagrams and tables to help illustrate the topic where appropriate.

You are expected to consult text books, the World Wide Web and academic journal papers while investigating the topic. 

Your report should include references to appropriate sources. The "2000 word" report size is for the main text and does not include the words in the bibliography citing references.

## Topic Area
Future prospects for high speed mobile Internet access.

You should address whatever technologies you deem appropriate. However, at minimum, your answer should address the technologies itemized below.

* Mobile WiMax-2 (IEEE 802.16m WirelessMAN-Advanced)
* High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA+)
* Long Term Evolution (LTE Advanced)

## Initial Bibliography
As mentioned above, you are expected to read widely in your study of this topic. However, to give you a starting point we draw the following articles to your attention.

> Pinoa, Jarno and Pentikousis, Kostas (June 2008) Mobile WiMAXInternet Protocol Journal,11(2).

> A. Bacioccola, C. Cicconetti, C. Eklund, L. Lenzini, Z. Li, E. Mingozzi, IEEE 802.16: History, Status and Future Trends,Computer Communications, Volume 33(2), February 2010, pp.113-123,

## Effort Allocated to this Assignment
You are likely to need to spend between sixteen and thirty hours of your time to complete this assignment.1

## Assessment Criteria
Bearing in mind that this assignment concerns the study of a technical area and the production of a report, the most appropriate "assessment criteria" are those in Appendix AC of the student handbook, namely those for "Assessment Criteria for Essays".Your work will be assessed on the basis of the following criteria:

* the breadth and depth of relevant knowledge and research that you demonstrate.  Simply regurgitating the material given in lectures will not be enough to gain the pass mark. You are expected to consult other sources;
* the level of understanding shown;
* the structure of your answers and the logical coherence that they display;
* the general quality of your writing.

This assignment will be assessed as the first contribution to your mark for this module. It can earn up to 40% ofthe marks for the module (the remaining 60% being associated with a traditional two-hour written examination).

Note that students who fail to submit coursework that contributes 20% or more to the assessment of a module, and who fail the module overall, will be given an 'N' resit indicator, which means that no resit will be allowed.


## Plagiarism
**Note:**  this is an individual assignment and must be completed as a one person effort by the student submitting the work.Your attention is drawn to section 6 of the Department's Student [Handbook](http://www.aber.ac.uk/~dcswww/Dept/Teaching/Handbook/), in particular, note the following, taken from the end of that section:

> The  following  simple  guidelines  are  intended  to  help  you  avoid  straying  from  legitimate  and  desirable  co-operation into the area of plagiarism:
> * append a bibliography to your work listing all the sources you have used, including electronic ones;
> * surround all direct quotations with inverted commas, and cite the precise source (including page numbers,or the URL and the date you accessed it if the source is on the Web) either in a footnote or in parentheses directly after the quotation;
> * use quotations sparingly and make sure that the bulk of the work is in your own words;
> * even if you don't use direct quotations, important ideas should still be credited;
> * remember that it is your own input that gives a piece of work merit. Whatever sources you have used, the structure and presentation of the argument should be your own. If you are using electronic sources, don't cut and paste sections into your work. If you are using books or papers, put them aside when you actually sit down to write. In this way you won't be tempted to copy in material that you don't understand, or be at risk of unintentionally copying in more material than a brief quotation, or of accidentally leaving quotations unmarked. Including someone else's work in your own is readily detectable because the style will be different.
> 
> Keep  a  sense  of  proportion,  and  exercise  common  sense  and  judgement. For  example,  it  is  not  necessary to attribute to a source, statements which have passed into the public domain and become commonplace.
>
> It is usually unnecessary to attribute lecture material, though again you should avoid quoting copiously, and you should never rely wholly on lecture notes.
>
> If in doubt, make sure that you properly quote and cite material in order to avoid any suspicion that you are trying to cheat and ask for advice if you are not sure.
